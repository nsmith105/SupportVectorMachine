**CS 445 - Machine Learning**

I used Scikit Learn's library for this assignment. We were tasked with classifying the Spambase dataset. This gave us a chance to play around with the hyperparameters of an SVM and this dataset - Top 5 vs Random 5 Features and Fewer vs More Features. This would then give us a reference for the next assignment, where were would implement our Bayesian Learning classifier.

**Results**
SVM Accuracy: 92%

Top 5 outperformed Random 5 by ~10%
